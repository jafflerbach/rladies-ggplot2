# Mob Programming with RLadies Santa Barbara: Intro to ggplot2

This repository accompanies the [August 2018 RLadies Santa Barbara meetup](https://rladies.github.io/meetup-presentations_santabarbara/2018_08_22_mobprogramming/mobprogramming_and_ggplot2.html#1). 

In this repo, the [RMarkdown file]() provides some code for you to start using ggplot2 with [np_visits.csv](), which is data for visits to US National Parks (sourced from the National Park Service at https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports).
