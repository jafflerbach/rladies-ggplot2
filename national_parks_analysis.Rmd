```

## The plan

We'll be mob programming in small teams to learn ggplot2. We'll be exploring data on visits to US National Parks (sourced from the National Park Service at https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports).  



## Load libraries and data 

The `tidyverse` package has `ggplot2`, as well as `dplyr`, which we will use today.

```{r load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages('tidyverse')

np_visit <- read_csv("data/np_visit.csv")
```

## Demo plot


```{r}

```

## Your turn!

Here are some questions to get you started: 

1. Can you create a plot that shows the trend in visitation to your favorite national park over time
2. How many national parks were established in each year in the US between XXXX and XXXX
